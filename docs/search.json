    "text": "Data: YÖK ATLAS database is used in this project due to access to large data set in thestats package.\nIn this project, number of choices of Industrial Engineering departments of universities in Ankara and the number of students placed in order of choice between 2018-2020 are provided.\nIn our dataset, we use industrial engineering data. Therefore, in the “Faculty” column, we have “Engineering Faculty,” and in the “Department” section, we specifically denote “Industrial Engineering.” The university column is designated as Ankara-based universities in the dataset. The columns from 8 to 16 provide information on how many times the Industrial Engineering department at that university was chosen as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on, up to the 9th preference. The columns from 17 to 25 give the number of students placed in order of choice.\nThrough this data set, we will be able to determine which university’s Industrial Engineering department is more preferred, and in conjunction with this parameter, we can understand which university is more favorable for students. Building upon these preferences, analyses can be conducted on the educational quality, student quality, and social facilities of the universities. Additionally, based on the placement preferences of admitted students, an analysis can be performed to understand the students’ preferences for a particular university and assess their level of interest.\nIn conclusion, this data set fundamentally provides access to a wide range of analytics, allowing a thorough assessment of universities based on the preferences of students majoring in Industrial Engineering. This makes it easier for us to comprehend the educational environment more deeply and to make judgments.\nYou can reach our data through this link : Our data\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Show the code\"\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(thestats)\n\nWarning: package 'thestats' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\ndata &lt;- list_score(region_names = \"all\", city_names = \"Ankara\",\n                   university_names = \"all\", department_names= \"Industrial Engineering\",\n                   lang = \"en\", var_ids=c(\"X141\", \"X142\", \"X143\", \"X144\", \"X145\", \"X146\",\"X147\", \"X148\", \"X149\", \n                                          \"X151\", \"X152\", \"X153\", \"X154\", \"X155\", \"X156\", \"X157\", \"X158\", \"X159\"))\nour_data &lt;- subset(data, department != \"Woodworking Industrial Engineering\")\n\nour_data &lt;-na.omit(our_data)\n\ncolnames(our_data) &lt;- c(\"ID\", \"Year\",\"Type\",\"Program Code\",\"University\",\"Faculty\",\"Department\",\"Number of choices in 1st place\",\"Number of choices in 2nd place\",\n                        \"Number of choices in 3rd place\",\"Number of choices in 4th place\",\"Number of choices in 5th place\",\"Number of choices in 6th place\",\n                        \"Number of choices in 7th place\",\"Number of choices in 8th place\",\"Number of choices in 9th place\",\n                        \"Number of students placed in 1st choice\", \"Number of students placed in 2nd choice\", \"Number of students placed in 3rd choice\",\n                        \"Number of students placed in 4th choice\",\"Number of students placed in 5th choice\",\"Number of students placed in 6th choice\",\n                        \"Number of students placed in 7th choice\",\"Number of students placed in 8th choice\",\"Number of students placed in 9th choice\")"
